# Code-Quiz

Created a timed multiple-choice quiz using HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

The user can start the quiz by clicking the 'Start' button that appears on the screen. After the button is clicked, a timer starts and the user is presented with a question. When the user selects an answer, they will be notified whether their chosen answer/option was correct or wrong. If the selected answer was wrong, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. If all questions are answered before the timer reaches 0, the user's score will be the remaining time on the timer. If the timer reaches 0 before the user completes all the questions, their score will be 0. When the game reaches the end from either completing all the questions or the timer reaching 0, the user will be presented with a screen with their score and a text box to submit their initials along with their score to the list of scores. The user can clear all scores if they would like and they may also retake the quiz if they so choose.
